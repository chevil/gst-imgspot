This is a gstreamer plugin for recognition
of specific images in a video stream.

The video stream can be a video file 
or a video stream
and the collection of images 
can be changed dynamically 
sending a message to the plugin.

The plugin uses OpenCV for the recognition of images.

To use it on Ubuntu, first install the dependencies :
> sudo apt-get install gstreamer-0.10 gstreamer-base-0.10 gstreamer-plugins-base-0.10 opencv libgst-ruby

Then compile the plugins with :

> sudo ./configure --prefix=/usr
> sudo make
> sudo make install

Then go to the script directory and launch the analysis of a video with :

> cd scripts
> ruby videofeed.rb ../data/slides.mp4 ../data/images

this script takes two additional optional arguments :

* algorithm [ 'histogram' by default ] : algorithm used for destection
* tolerance [ 0.10 by default ] : distance tolerance to detect an image
