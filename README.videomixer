# this script is a four channel video mixer 
# author : ydegoyon@gmail.com

# the script takes commands from http ( by default on port 9999 )
# at first it starts with a black screen of 320x240 ( no emission )
# then you can manipulate the video composition 
# with the following commands:
# 
# adding a video source :
# POST /inputs/add params : {channel: n, url: 'file:///path/video.avi'}  
# POST /inputs/add params : {channel: n, url: 'device:///dev/video0'}  
# POST /inputs/add params : {channel: n, url: 'http:///server.com:8000/videostream.mpg'}  
#
# this command can be achieve by using the node.js script :
# node addsource.js <channel> file:///Videoz/video.avi

# removing a video source :
# POST /inputs/remove params : {channel: n}  
#
# this command can be achieve by using the node.js script :
# node deletesource.js <channel>

# positioning a channel
# POST /inputs/move params : {channel:n, posx: nnn, posy: nnn}  
#
# this command can be achieve by using the node.js script :
# node movesource.js <channel> <x> <y>

# resizing a channel
# POST /inputs/resize params : {channel:n, width: nnn, height: nnn}  
#
# this command can be achieve by using the node.js script :
# node resizesource.js <channel> <width> <height>

# recording the output
# POST /outputs/record params : {file: '/path/recording.mp4'}  
# note : as the pipe is restarted when you change some parameters,
# we actually have to record in a file name with the date
# not to crush previous recordings
# the real name of the recording will be :
# /tmp/output-mm-dd-hh:mm:ss.mp4 for example
#
# this command can be achieve by using the node.js script :
# node recordoutput.js <file>

# starting and stopping the mixer
# POST /outputs/state params : {state: start|stop}  
# IMPORTANT NOTE : when you modify parameters of the mixer,
# all we do is storing them until you restart the pipe,
# so all your modifications will be visible
# _only_ when you send a start message to the mixer.
# this is due to some limitations in which parameters
# can be modified dynamically with gstreamer.
#
# this command can be achieve by using the node.js script :
# node setstate.js <start|stop>

# more optional features : detecting images on a channel
# POST /inputs/detect params : {channel:n, imagedir: /path/slides, minscore: score}  
#
# this command can be achieve by using the node.js script :
# node detectsource.js <channel> </path/to/slides> <minscore>

KNOWN BUGS :
============

* if the machine is not powerful enough, audio drops or cuts
(but the audio in the file is still recorded)
